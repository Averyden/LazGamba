# Special thanks
Lazar710, for the idea itself. While not directly giving me the idea yourself, it was still a funny idea that popped up in my head because of you.
BluTsunami, for the idea with the whole L-Coins thing, really creative pun and gave me the motivation to implement the currency itself.
Fallanis, for being the GAMBA master himself.
Shylily, for having this amazing community, idk where I would be had I not stumbled into this community.
